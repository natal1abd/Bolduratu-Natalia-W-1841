Coding style is how your code looks, plain and simple. And by “your,” I actually mean you, 
the person who is reading this article. Coding style is extremely personal and everyone has their own
preferred style. You can discover your own personal style by looking back over code that you’ve written 
when you didn’t have a style guide to adhere to.

That is actually the art of programming – to take a complex task and code it in a way that is both correct 
and human-readable. A good code style greatly assists in that.
